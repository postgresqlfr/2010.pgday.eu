====== Training ======

~~NOTOC~~

The schedule for PGDay.EU 2010 includes a day of training courses on PostgreSQL and related topics. Each session is offered at a cost of 150â‚¬ and includes:

  * Approximately 3.5 hours of training
  * Lunch
  * A hotel venue

Each training course is provided by a third-party company which is wholly responsible for the course content. The proceeds of the training are shared between the company providing each course and PostgreSQL Europe.

If you wish to take a training course, you must register in advance when you [[register|register for the conference]]. Places are limited, so book early to avoid disappointment!
