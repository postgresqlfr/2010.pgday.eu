~~NOTOC~~

====== Hotels ======

There are many different hotel options around Stuttgart. Visitors are of course free to pick any hotel they prefer - there is no requirement to use the same hotel that the conference will be held at.
==== Millennium Hotel ====
The [[Venue|venue]] itself is a hotel, and we have negotiated a good rate with this hotel. This will be the most convenient option, since it's right next to the conference action!

== Booking your room using our negotiated group rate ==
Our rate which is available from the 5th to 10th December includes Internet access (normally 22€ per day!) and breakfast. Or rate costs €150 / night.

Unfortunately, due to technical issues with the hotels website, it is no longer possible to book using this rate //online//. However, the rate is **still available**. In order to book using this rate, you have to contact the hotel directly via telephone or email. When you make your reservation, quote our group reservation code **PGEUROPE**, and you will get access to this rate.
