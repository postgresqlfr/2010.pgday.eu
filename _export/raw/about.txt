====== About PGDay ======

PGDay.EU - The European PostgreSQL Day - is by far the largest PostgreSQL conference in Europe. It is organized by PostgreSQL Europe, with participation from most of the PostgreSQL user groups around Europe.

PGDay.EU is a unique chance for European PostgreSQL users and developers to catch up, learn, build relationships, get to know each other and consolidate a  real network of professionals that use and work with PostgreSQL.

The conference will cover a wide range of topics, as we expect talks ranging from internals discussions led by core developers to end-user case-studies from small companies as well as large multinational corporations and government organizations, all who run their business on PostgreSQL.

Given this wide range of talks, the conference is suitable for many different audiences:

    * DBAs already using PostgreSQL, or considering doing so.
    * Developers of any kind of applications, from hobbyists to large web- and enterprise applications.
    * Decision makers interested in evaluating the worlds most advanced open source database as an alternative to traditional proprietary products.
    * PostgreSQL contributors - code, documentation, support - whatever you help with!
    * Open source enthusiasts in general!

The conference will run multiple parallel tracks, covering the different technical levels to make sure there is always something interesting for everybody. We will also run a mix of English and German tracks to cater for both the local and the global audience - our goal is to always have at least one talk in each language running at any time.

Next to the conference, we will also team up with several of the companies around Europe who offer PostgreSQL training, for a day of discounted short PostgreSQL training sessions.
